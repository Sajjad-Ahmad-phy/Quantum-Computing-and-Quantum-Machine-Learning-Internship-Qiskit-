Title:
# Unveiling the mysteries of Quantum Computing and Quantum Machine Learning
The qiskit scripts in this repository are my internship work. It was a research internship in quantum computing and Quantum Machine Learning.

In this research journey, my focus was on the basics of quantum computing, and some intricate protocols that underpin its operations. My focus was not just theoretical; it was on real-world applications in machine learning optimization problems.
